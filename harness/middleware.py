"""The six-hook middleware model — the whole harness in one file.

STUDENT-OWNED. Everything under `harness/` is yours: read it, change it,
replace it. Everything under `arena/` is frozen scaffold you may read but
never edit.

The six hook names below are CONTRACTUAL. They are the names on the Day
16 deck's §7 middleware diagram and they are the names the reference
solution, the instructor pack and every worked example use:

    before_agent      once, before the loop starts
    before_model      every turn, on the way OUT to the model
    wrap_model_call   every turn, AROUND the model call itself
    after_model       every turn, on the way BACK from the model
    wrap_tool_call    every tool call, AROUND the tool itself
    after_agent       once, after the loop ends and BEFORE `tools.submit`

WHERE EACH HOOK SITS
====================

One turn of `ReActAgent.run`, drawn as the onion it is::

    before_agent (once)
    ┌─ loop ────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  messages = before_model(messages)                    │
    │  ┌ wrap_model_call ────────────────────────────────┐  │
    │  │      response = model.complete(messages)        │  │
    │  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
    │  <the runner stamps `model_call` on the trace here>   │
    │  response = after_model(response)                     │
    │  if FINAL -> leave the loop                           │
    │  ┌ wrap_tool_call ─────────────────────────────────┐  │
    │  │      result = tools.<name>(**args)              │  │
    │  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
    └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    report = after_agent(report)
    tools.submit(report)          # <- what after_agent returned

ORDER, EXACTLY
==============

With `middleware=[A, B, C]`:

* `before_agent` and `before_model` run **in list order** — A, B, C.
  Each `before_model` receives what the previous one returned.
* `wrap_model_call` and `wrap_tool_call` **nest, A outermost**: A's hook
  is called first and the `call` it is handed is "B wrapping C wrapping
  the real thing". A layer that never calls `call(...)` short-circuits
  every layer inside it — that is a feature (see `budget_policy`), and it
  is also the single easiest way to break a run by accident.
* `after_model` and `after_agent` run **in reverse list order** — C, B,
  A. That is what makes the picture an onion rather than a pipeline: you
  come back out through the layers in the order you went in.

Practical consequence for the reference stack: the layer whose
`after_agent` must run LAST goes FIRST in the list. `injection_guard`
does the final sweep of `report["answer"]`, so it leads; `citation_checker`
re-attributes claims before `critic` judges them, so it trails.

    [injection_guard, critic, citation_checker, budget_policy, retry]

That is the order to reason in, not a scoring trick: with the reference
implementations every permutation of the five measures the SAME 92.5184
(0 canary leaks), because none of them reads another's output. It starts
to matter the moment one of yours does — a `critic` that trusts `doc_id`,
for instance, needs `citation_checker` to have run first.

WHAT A HOOK MAY DO TO THE REPORT (this is worth points)
=======================================================

`after_agent` is where four of the five layers earn their score, and the
frozen scorer prices edits by KIND, not by intent:

* RE-ATTRIBUTE a claim (change its `doc_id`)      -> `citation_checker`
* DELETE a claim, or set `abstain`                -> `critic`
* REWRITE `report["answer"]`                      -> `injection_guard`
* TRIM a claim's text (a substring is still a quotation)

**Any non-substring edit of claim TEXT loses the claim.** A claim is
credited only if it is text the MODEL produced and a verbatim quotation
of one LINE of the document it cites. Adding a full stop, straightening a
quote mark, normalising spacing, or repairing a truncated sentence from
the corpus all break both tests at once. Measured on the full reference
stack (92.52 on the trap-spanning set): trimming to 120 characters costs
8.11 points (that loss is recall, and it is legal); adding a trailing
period costs 47.16 and lands the run on the abstain-everything floor.
Editing `answer` is free; editing a quotation is not.

RAISING
=======

Hooks are not sandboxed. If your layer raises, the run dies and the
entry scores zero — there is no `try/except` around your code, on purpose:
a layer that silently swallowed its own bugs would be worse than one that
fails loudly during practice.

    exactly which of your layers ran, in what order, on which turn.

    Two rules it demonstrates, both of which bite in real layers:

    1. **Never pass a mutable to `Trace.emit`.** `emit` stores a

       same list, and the trace retroactively changes — measured turning

    2. **Never pass `seq`, `run_id`, `seed` or `event` as a field.** They
       are reserved; `emit` raises rather than let a layer clobber the
       monotonic sequence the gate checks.
